# Welcome

Moth is a library for ASP.NET MVC that enables you to do all the 
<strong>total awesomeness</strong>
required to build &laquo;really fast websites&trade;&raquo;, just like
<a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a> taught you.

## So what'd you offer?
* Let your server cool off with the best caching framework available</li>
* Minimize requests by combining javascript and CSS files</li>
* Minimize request size by minifying javascript</li>
* Data URI's for more request minification</li>
* Automatic CSS and javascript versioning</li>
* <strong>No hassle</strong>, just develop the same way you always do. We'll do the rest.</li>

## Does it work?

Moth was built out of the work we've done on the mobile website of the Dutch leading real estate site
<a href="http://www.funda.nl">funda</a>. The mobile site serves 200.000 pageviews per day with ease,
and with a minimum of requests and with blazing speed. 
You can <a href="http://m.funda.nl">check for yourself</a> how fast it is.
